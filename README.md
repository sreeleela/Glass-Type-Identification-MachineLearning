# Glass Type Identification 
Depending on the requirement, there are different types of glasses used for various purposes. The glass type depends on the minerals present and the proportion in which these minerals are present. Other important feature of glass is Refractive Index. These features contribute to the physical and chemical properties of the glass, and makes it suitable for a specific purpose. So, based on refractive index and mineral proportion we can identify the type of class. In this paper, I used different machine learning classification techniques to classify the type of glass. I also compared different classification techniques to find the best fit.<br>
The following algorithms are implemented:<br>
DTC - Decision Tree Classifier<br>
GNB - GaussianNB<br>
KNB - KNeighbors Classifier<br>
LR - Logistic Regression<br>
LDA - Linear Discriminant Analysis<br>
MLP - Multilayer Perceptron Classifier<br>
RF - Random Forest Classifier<br>
SVM - Support Vector Machine<br>

# Instructions to run the project
conda 4.3.30<br>
Python 3.6.3<br>
The above two are used to build the project<br>
<br>
open anaconda command prompt, navigate to "code" folder in the project and type the following command<br>
python RunMe.py<br>
<br>
The above command runs the entire project and all the graphs and output can be found in images folder(in code folder).
